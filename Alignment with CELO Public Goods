Anzi Finance’s work aligns closely with Celo Public Goods (CeloPG), an initiative launched in Q1 2024 to streamline community governance and fund impactful projects within the Celo ecosystem. By participating in the Credit Collective, Anzi contributes to CeloPG’s focus on ReFi and financial inclusion. CeloPG’s funding programs, such as the CeloRPGF0 (Retroactive Public Goods Funding) and quadratic funding rounds, provide opportunities for projects like Anzi to receive community support and resources, further amplifying their impact.

Anzi’s efforts to provide affordable credit access for SMBs align with CeloPG’s mission to support projects that generate long-term value for the ecosystem. By fostering economic inclusion and leveraging Celo’s mobile-first infrastructure, Anzi Finance is a prime example of how DeFi can drive real-world impact, a core pillar of CeloPG’s vision.
