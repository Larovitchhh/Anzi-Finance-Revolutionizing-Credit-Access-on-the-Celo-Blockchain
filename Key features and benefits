Anzi Finance’s integration with the Celo blockchain offers several key features and benefits:Tokenized Credit Default Guarantees: Anzi Finance uses blockchain technology to tokenize credit default guarantees, ensuring transparency and security. If an SMB defaults on a loan, Anzi compensates lenders with a portion of the principal, reducing financial risk and improving portfolio stability.

Automation and Efficiency: Through smart contracts, Anzi automates guarantee payment execution, minimizing debt losses and streamlining processes for lenders. This automation reduces operational costs and enhances cash flow, making lending more efficient.

Cross-Border Accessibility: Built on Celo’s global, mobile-first blockchain, Anzi’s solutions support cross-border transactions, enabling lenders and SMBs to operate seamlessly across regions. This is particularly impactful in emerging markets, where access to global capital markets is often limited.

Compliance and Security: Anzi Finance ensures compliance with local regulations and uses real-time proof-of-reserve mechanisms and a reinsurance fund to back its guarantees. This builds trust among lenders and borrowers, fostering broader adoption.

Support for Stablecoins: By leveraging Celo’s stablecoins (e.g., cUSD, cEUR), Anzi Finance mitigates the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies, making its solutions more practical for everyday financial transactions.
