Anzi Finance’s growth is bolstered by strategic partnerships and accelerator programs. In November 2024, Anzi was selected for the Real World Assets (RWA) Base Camp, a 12-week virtual accelerator program by Outlier Ventures and Singularity Finance. This program provides mentorship, investment, and support in areas like token design, marketing, and engineering, helping Anzi scale its operations and drive mainstream adoption of tokenized RWAs.

Additionally, Anzi Finance has formed an alliance with Minteo, a platform specializing in stablecoin tokenization and management in Latin America. This partnership enhances Anzi’s ability to serve SMBs in the region by integrating stablecoin infrastructure with its credit guarantee solutions, further expanding its reach in emerging markets.
