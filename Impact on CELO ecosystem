Anzi Finance has made significant contributions to the Celo ecosystem, particularly through its participation in the Credit Collective, a community-led fund focused on pioneering on-chain credit solutions. As part of the first cohort of the Credit Collective, Anzi Finance is helping to shape the future of decentralized credit by providing innovative tools for lenders and borrowers. This collaboration underscores Anzi’s role in advancing Celo’s goal of financial inclusion, particularly for underserved communities and businesses.

By enabling SMBs to access loans without collateral at better interest rates, Anzi Finance addresses a critical gap in traditional financial systems. Its tokenized guarantees reduce the risk for lenders, encouraging them to extend credit to businesses that might otherwise be excluded. This approach not only supports economic growth in emerging markets but also strengthens Celo’s regenerative finance (ReFi) ecosystem, which prioritizes real-world impact and ecological benefits.
