The Celo blockchain, known for its mobile-first, carbon-negative design, is an ideal home for Anzi Finance. Celo’s mission to make financial tools accessible to anyone with a smartphone, regardless of location or economic status, resonates with Anzi’s goal of democratizing credit access for SMBs. Launched in 2019 as a Layer 1 blockchain and later transitioning to an Ethereum Layer 2 chain using Optimism’s OP Stack, Celo offers low-cost transactions, stablecoin support (e.g., cUSD, cEUR, cREAL), and a user-friendly design that uses phone numbers as public keys. These features make it a powerful platform for DeFi applications like Anzi Finance.

Anzi Finance leverages Celo’s infrastructure to deliver its tokenized credit default guarantees. The platform’s integration with Celo’s ecosystem enables seamless, low-cost transactions and supports cross-border operations, which are critical for serving SMBs in emerging markets. Additionally, Celo’s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism ensures energy efficiency and scalability, aligning with Anzi’s commitment to sustainable and accessible financial solutions.
