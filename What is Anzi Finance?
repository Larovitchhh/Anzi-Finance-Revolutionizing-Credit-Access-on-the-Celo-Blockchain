Anzi Finance is a DeFi platform focused on mitigating credit risk for financial intermediaries, particularly those offering productive loans to SMBs. Operating on the Celo blockchain, Anzi Finance provides tokenized credit default guarantees, enabling lenders to offer competitive interest rates while managing default risks effectively. These guarantees are backed by smart contracts, real-time proof-of-reserve mechanisms, and a reinsurance fund, ensuring maximum security and transparency for all parties involved.

The platform’s blockchain-powered API and web app deliver a secure, fast, and cross-border solution for instant, automated guarantee payments. This automation minimizes debt losses, safeguards portfolio metrics, and improves cash flow for lenders, making it an easy-to-integrate tool for financial institutions. By focusing on SMBs—often underserved by traditional financial systems—Anzi Finance aligns with Celo’s vision of creating a more inclusive financial ecosystem.
